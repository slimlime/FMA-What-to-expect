# Future Makers Academy

We know you are excited to join the academy and you would like to prepare as much as possible. Many of the concepts we would prefer you learn while in the academy under the guidance of your mentors rather than attempting them on your own and getting them wrong - it’s often harder to unlearn some of these things. 

That said there are a few things you can do that you can spend time on before acceleration that will help you during acceleration.

## Become confident with your keyboard

We value developers being confident at the keyboard. If you are not already, we would like to encourage you to become a proficient touch typist.  

How fast should you be? Try and get to at least consistently 60 words per minute. If you are faster than this you are probably good enough. 

There are various sites and tools that can help you in achieving keyboard confidence. Investing 15 minutes each day on improving your typing is often the best way to improve.

Some tools we would recommend...

[TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/) - in-browser touch typing tutor.  
[Typing Master 10 for Windows](http://www.typingmaster.com/) - this is probably one of the best typing tutorials out there, unfortunately for windows.  

## Learn how to use Git & GitHub

As an organisation we largely use Git & GitHub as our version control tool. If you have not worked with either of these before it’s worth spending some time getting to grips with them. When learning Git we would like you to understand how to use it from the command line, not just from visual editors. To get you started we recommend the following resources...  

[Git Branching Game](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/) - Game for learning git branching and navigation  
[GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) - Tutorials from GitHub on using git and GitHub  
[Git Exercises](https://gitexercises.fracz.com/) - Learn and practice git, discover features  

## Learn the Unix command line basics

If you are unfamiliar with unix command line basics we highly recommend learning them early on. Whether you do this by playing the [terminal game](http://www.mprat.org/Terminus/) or going through a [Pluralsight Linux Command Line Basics](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/linux-cli-fundamentals/table-of-contents) or using any of the other online tools is up to you. A brief summary of the basics are below...   

[Unix](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unixintro.html) is composed of several object primitives which make up an operating system. Understand what a file, directory, and process is in the world of Unix.  

[The Command Line Interface](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix1.html) is the primary method of interacting with a Unix OS - even as graphical interfaces exist. Through your career, you will need to navigate modify, and create directories.  

[File manipulation](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix2.html) is also a critical bit. Know how to copy, move, or remove files.  

[Redirection and pipes](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix3.html) are Unix's way of 'forwarding' traffic that usually goes to the standard output.  One of the great things about using pipes to redirect one program's output _(stdout)_ into a second program's input _(stdin)_ is that it allows both programs to run simultaneously and permits data to be transferred between them continuously rather than having to pass it through temporary text files or through the display screen and having to wait for one program to be completed before the next program begins.  

[Understanding Linux users and groups](https://linuxacademy.com/howtoguides/posts/show/topic/12659-understanding-linux-users-and-groups) is an important part of understanding the security model in Linux and how you can secure or share resources.  

[Permissions and access writes](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix5.html) make sure that your files are only accessible by you and no one else. In the world of cloud computing where resources are shared, this becomes even more critical as is a good understanding of the [Principle of Least Privilege](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-principle-least-privilege-polp-best-practice-information-security-and-compliance).  

[Bash scripting](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html) enables you to easily write your own command line tools that you can execute at a later time.  This promotes consistency and automation and means that you'll make less mistakes.
